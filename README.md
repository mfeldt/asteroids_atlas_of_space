This repository is based on Eleanor Lutz' [Asteroids Atlas of Space](https://github.com/eleanorlutz/asteroids_atlas_of_space).  This version will slowly evolve into a Blender, 3D version of the map, which will eventually additionally include spacecraft from the HORIZON database.

For an excellent manual on what the different files are, and how they can be used, please refer to the original repository.
